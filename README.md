# Cocoon components
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/cocooncomponents

This project defines several components for Apache Cocoon, which have been used in many projects over the years.
Like Cocoon itself, this code is sometimes 'ancient', but it is developed occasionally.

The branch 2.1 is used for Cocoon 2.1.x projects. There is a 2.2 branch, but I consider Cocoon 2.2 to have failed.
I am aware of Cocoon 3.x, but that never took off (because of some wrong choices, in my opinion).

Some comments may still be in Dutch, but I try to only write comments in English from now on.
